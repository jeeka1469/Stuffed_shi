As an AI model, I cannot create files. However, I can provide the optimized function code with type hints in Python PEP8 style. Below is a generic example:

```python
from typing import List

def calculate_sum(nums: List[int]) -> int:
    """
    This function takes a list of integers as input,
    and returns their sum.
    """
    return sum(nums)
```
Please provide a specific function that needs optimization and adding type hints to.
